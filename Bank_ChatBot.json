Customers enjoying net banking facility offered by our bank can initiate the funds transfer request online. Walk-in customers will, however, have to give their contact details (complete address and telephone number, etc.) to the branch. This will help the branch to refund the money to the customer in case credit could not be afforded to the beneficiary`s bank account or the transaction is rejected / returned for any reason. NEFT has a provision to send SMS/E-mail regarding confirmation of credit of beneficiary`s account, Step-2: The remitting branch prepares a Structure Financial Messaging Solution (SFMS) message and sends it to its Service Centre for NEFT, Step-3: The Service centre forwards the same to the local RBI (National Clearing Cell, Mumbai) to be included for the next available settlement, Step-4: The RBI at the clearing Centre sorts the transactions bank-wise and prepares accounting entries of net debit or credit for passing on to the banks participating in the system. Thereafter, bank-wise remittance messages are forwarded to banks through their service centre for NEFT, Step-5: The receiving banks process the inward remittance messages received from RBI and effect the credit to the beneficiary accounts."]
